## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM CEO REPORT (REMEMBER THESE)

1. **Feb 10-12 launch is NOT realistic** - Aim for Feb 20 public launch (soft launch Feb 18-19 is doable)
2. **Chinese caps are critical path** - 15-21 days lead time, order TODAY with air freight
3. **FBO registration required** - Cannot sell without it, submit Feb 7 (usually instant/1-2 days)
4. **Margins are tight at low volume** - Need to scale to 5,000+ units for healthy economics (£1.82 → £1.29 COGS)
5. **Subscription is key** - 10-15% subscription rate by Month 6 creates predictable revenue
6. **Break-even: Month 6-7** - With £10-15K initial investment + aggressive execution
7. **Exit timeline: 24-36 months** - Target acquirers: Myprotein, Grenade, Applied Nutrition (3-5x revenue multiple)
